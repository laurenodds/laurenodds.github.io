      <h1>About Lauren Odds</h1>
      <p>
        We’re a queer pop-rock-punk band based in Victoria, B.C., made up of Lauren on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Ariel on drums, Hannah on lead guitar, and Miri on bass. 
Our music comes from the messiness of non-conformity in a world that loves its boxes neat. Rooted in our personal and collective experiences, our songs explore identity, vulnerability, the pressure to fit in — and what it means to push back. From beauty standards to heartbreak, we’re here to make noise about it.
​We make music to feel seen, and to help others feel seen too. Whether you’re dancing, crying, or both at once, you belong here.
